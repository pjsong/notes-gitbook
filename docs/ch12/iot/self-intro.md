# intro

My name is Jeson, I have work experiences over 10 years.

When I graduated from my first college ShangHai Institute of Electric Power, I joined HuNan Computer Company, a state-owned enterprise,which focused on terminal, encrypted-keyboard design & manufacturing, as a technical engineer.
Two years later I joined Broadcast-TV bureau of ZheJiang, as a technician.
As I feel I was not keeping up with new technology skills and need to improve myself, I started my study for master degree in CentralSouthUniversity. There I learnt how to write paper and to do research.
I started my new career as a Java developer, in Dongguan, Guangdong. The company, Dolan Designs was a Foreign Representative Office, our technical team is responsible for maintaining the ecommerce website.
Nearly four years later, I joined IBM public and distribution sector. There I solidated and developed my java skills, and learn a lot of Ecommerce background industry knowledges.
After that, I did some short-time project. I worked for TengTa, IVI, OMD, and JiXiang.

In JiXiang I was the `leader developer for GI integration`. `GI is a game interface`, acting as a central entry for customer to join and play whichever game they like. From a keybird view it's a game hub.
 `it contains two modules`, one is for integration with inner services like Customer Membership Management, Cash Management, Payment Management etc. The other module is for introducing other games from vendors, which provide service entry and we use that to lead our customer to the game.
 After 1 month for POC, and 3 months development, it was ready for deploy, and started its trial runing stage.

In OMD I lead the whole vendor-machine project implementation. The system is more complicated than the one before, for more technologies involved.

The first `subproject` is the `webplatform` for the vendor owner/runner. From that web user interface they can view their sales reports and manage the merchandise.
The second subproject is the `local running system`. We used embeded operation system lubuntu to monitor the vendor-machine local devices, such as Cash Operator from ITL, Motor Driver board, user interface, etc.
The third subproject is `integration system` for communication between former two subprojects. we run Rabbitmq as message broker, to send local generated data to remote, and send remote operations like update merchandise information to local system.
This project lasted more than a year. In April 2016 it showed up in ShangHai Reproductive Health Devices Exhibition.

I'm new to Vantiq, but after days learning, I know that it's a powerful PaaS product, especially fit for IoT industry. it has an uniform platform, namely modelo,  where the users can develop and operate in a single site. In most cases it needs no coding, no integration testing or dev/ops life cycle, just design, and a little integration work. At the same time, Vantiq has to provide customers with more chanllenging feature or capability, like replacing the deployment, or redesigning the user interface, maybe more others. I think I can utillize my front-end and operational skills to help with that.

For me, I'm afraid I was not so good at live oral communications in english, I'd prefer more text based communications like email, or text chatting.

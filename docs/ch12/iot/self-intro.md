# intro

My name is Jeson, I have work experiences over 10 years. 

When I graduated from my first college ShangHai Institute of Electric Power, I joined HuNan Computer Company, a state-owned enterprise,which focused on terminal, encrypted-keyboard design & manufacturing, as a technical engineer. 
Two years later I joined Broadcast-TV bureau of ZheJiang, as a technician.
As I feel I was not keeping up with knowledge acquring and new technology skills, I started studying in CentralSouthUniversity. There I learnt how to write paper, and how to do research.
I started my new career as a Java developer, in Dongguan, Guangdong. The company was a Foreign Representative Office, our technical team is responsible for maintaining the ecommerce website.
Nearly four years later, I joined IBM public and distribution sector. There I solicated and developed my java skills, and learn a lot of Ecommerce background industry knowledges.
After that, I do jobs Represent myself. I worked for TengTa, IVI, OMD, and JiXiang, some are parttime, some are short-time project.

In JiXiang I was the leader developer for GI integration. GI is a game interface, acting as a center for customer to join and play whichever game they like. From a keybird view it's a game hub, it contains two modules, one is for integration with current modules like Customer Membership Management, Cash Management, Payment Management etc. The other module is for introducing other vendor game, they provide service entry and we use that to lead our customer to the game. After 1 month for POC, and 3 months development, it was ready for deploy, and started its trial runing stage.

In OMD I lead the whole vendor-machine project implementation. The system is more complicated than the one before, for more technologies involed. 
The first subproject is the webplatform for the vendor owner/runner. From that web they can view their sales reports and manage the merchandise.
The second subproject is the local running system. We selected embeded system lubuntu to monitor the vendor-machine local devices, such as Cash Operator from ITL, Motor Driver board, user interface, etc.
The third subproject is for Communication between the first two subprojects. we run Rabbitmq as message broker, to send data generated locally to remote, and send remote operations to local.
This project takes more than a year. In April 2016 it showed up in Exhibition of ShangHai Reproductive Health Devices.

I'm new to Vantiq, but after days learning, I know that it's a powerful PaaS implementation especially fit for IoT industry. it has an uniform platform, namely modelo,  where the users can develop and operate in a single site. it needs no coding(most cases), no testing or dev/ops life cycle, just design, and a little integration work. At the same time, Vantiq has to catter customer with more chanllenging feature or capabbility, like replacing the deployment, or redesigning the user interface, maybe more others.

For me, I'm afraid I was not so good at live oral communications in english, I'd prefer more text based communications like email, or text chatting.
